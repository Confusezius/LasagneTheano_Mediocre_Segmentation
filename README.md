## (obsolete) Liver & Lesion Segmentation
Theano-based scripts to run 2D or 3D liver and lesion segmentation on datasets provided through https://lits-challenge.com.  
This pipeline makes use of the `Lasagne`-Wrapper for `Theano` and `Python 2.7`.   

Note however that the scripts shown are merely listed for archival purposes and would need to be readjusted to newer versions of Theano and Lasagne.
